here is an working example that you can play with.

1. open wei.Rproj with R Studio
2. open file Octopus.R
3. run all lines

Notes:
function octopus.glm.nb.all() in file GlmNbAll.R packs the whole pipe line together.
    1. sub function run.normalize() does TMM Normalization with edgeR
    2. sub function  run_slice() calculate ANOVA for one gene
    3. other codes are for performance optimizing, you donâ€™t need to read that.
